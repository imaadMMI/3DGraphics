We have made 12 objects for this deliverable. Four of them are our main 
objects, with the other 8 being side objects. Here is how we modeled our main objects, set up the scene and set up the render.

MODELLED THEM:

1. Axe:

Inspiration:

This is the initial sketch of the axe.

Modelling:
When modeling the axe, I made use of a cube for the blade and used tools such as subdivision modifiers, mirror modifiers, extrude tools as well as smoothing by angle. For the handle I used a cylinder and used loop cuts to make an irregular shape. Then for the leather handles I used a cylinder and scaled them on the z axis, beveled the faces and then I made pointy spikes out of cones and used cylinders for the clay holder in the middle of the blade.

This is the texture used for the blade:

This is the texture used for the wooden handle:

2. Hammer (Saad Rakhangi):
  
To make the hammer I started off using a cube and applying sub-division modifiers to it. Then used beveling to give it a more of a hammer shape. Later I used multiple other objects to give more detailing on the hammer block.

I then discovered the use of the boolean modifier which could put engravings on the model. I used the text tool to add text written in norse which I could then convert to a mesh and then use boolean modifier to engrave them on to the hammer. 

I then made a handle and a metal cup below the hammer by using a cylinder and the extrude and scaling tools to give them shape. 

Looked at youtube videos to learn how to make textures on objects. Added Scratchy texture look to the hammer using voronai textures and bump nodes to it.
